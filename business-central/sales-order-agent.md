# Sales Order Agent overview (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

The Sales Order Agent helps Business Central users automate the entire process of capturing sales orders from their customers. The agent uses AI to analyze customer requests received via email, locate the customer in Business Central, and engage in multi-turn email conversations to clarify requests if important details are missing or more choices are available. It also checks and informs the customer about the availability of the items that they're looking for and follows up with a sales quote. The quote is formatted as a PDF and includes the requested items, quantities, units of measure, prices, taxes, requested delivery dates, provided external document reference and other important details.

If the customer decides to update the quote by adding or modifying sales lines, the agent assists with these changes by locating the quote and making the requested updates. Once the customer confirms the quote's accuracy, the agent converts it into a sales order, which is then also shared with the customer via email, following user's confirmation. 

Users can inspect the agent's steps and created sales documents. They can easily identify the data entered by the agent compared to data generated by Business Central's own business logic, and provide more input if needed&mdash;for instance, adding discounts or updating shipping costs.

The agent is readily available in the product. To activate it, you need to specify the email inbox you want the agent to monitor. Additionally, you can specify your preferences for certain aspects of the agent's behavior and designate the users authorized to use the agent to process customers' orders, enabling the agent to act on behalf of a company, department, or team—not just an individual user.

## Operation

The Sales Order Agent is designed to run autonomously in the background, using AI to perform its tasks while keeping users informed about key steps and involving them when necessary. Involvement might be needed in specific scenarios, for instance to review outgoing messages or to provide missing details, or based on configured preferences.

Conceptually, the agent interacts with Business Central functionality in a manner similar to how Business Central users interact with it. The agent is provided with general instructions, expressed in natural language, outlining how the process of capturing sales orders should be handled. It then uses UI metadata, such as captions, tooltips, and other properties, combined with the data presented on Business Central pages and its own instructions, to determine each step required to complete the task. Starting from the designated Role Center, it navigates the pages, invokes UI actions, and enters data as a user would. This approach allows a high degree of flexibility and adaptability for the agent to achieve its goal because the agent’s interaction surface and steps aren’t hardcoded. Instead, AI determines them based on the context of each step.

This flexibility enables the agent to discover and interact with relevant custom fields and actions. It can also attempt to automatically resolve validation errors by processing displayed error messages and adjusting the input accordingly.

The agent operates within the permissions and profile (role) assigned to it by the administrator. Permissions define which areas of the product (tables) the agent has access to, while the profile outlines the UX elements (pages and actions) the agent can engage with during its work. Default permissions and a profile are assigned to the agent out of the box; however, administrators can update these permissions as needed.

The agent relies on an internal email dispatcher, running as a background task, to continuously monitor a designated mailbox for item requests. The dispatcher triggers the agent to perform tasks and subsequently sends results, such as prepared sales quotes or orders, to the customer in response.

The agent helps with composing email bodies based on the context of the current step. For instance, it can list available inventory or provide a brief description of the attached sales quote or sales order. Additionally, it can detect and flag irrelevant or potentially malicious email content, prompting users to review and decide how to proceed.  

> [!Note]
> The Sales Order Agent is provided as an app, pre-installed in the countries where it is being previewed. The app includes agent-specific pages, permission sets, and a profile. While in preview, the app is not extensible by developers, nor is it possible to view or adjust the agent's instructions.

## Process flow

Processing a sales quote request into an order involves three participants:

- Customer who requests a sales quote via email
- Sales order agent, which monitors the mailbox and handles the incoming request and creates the quote and order  
- Business Central user who reviews agent tasks

The general flow is illustrated in the figure, which is followed by more details of the steps. The actual flow might vary depending on factors such as follow-up requests, changes or cancellations in review, blocking issues, and so on.
