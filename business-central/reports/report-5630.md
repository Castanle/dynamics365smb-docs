# Maintenance - Analysis (report)

The **Maintenance - Analysis** report shows detailed maintenance expenses for fixed assets. 

You can choose between using posting dates or fixed asset posting dates when restricting what data is shown in the report.

The report has three amount fields that can show maintenance amounts broken down by different maintenance types. Select the maintenance code for the maintenance type you want to include in the report.

The report has three period fields for which you can select one of the options: Before Starting Date, Net Change or at Ending Date. Net Change is the period between the starting and ending date. The selected option determines how the report calculates the maintenance amounts shown in the report.

The report allows for grouping fixed assets and calculating totals by category. For example, maintenance expenses for fixed assets can be shown for each fixed asset class.

You can also choose to see amounts for each fixed asset.
