# Financial Report (report)

The **Financial Report** report shows general ledger (G/L) transactions in a given period, grouped by a setup you define for rows and columns.

You can:

* Format the report to add bold font, italics, underlines, and page breaks to lines.
* Change the row setup to group several accounts from different areas of the general ledger on one line.
* Change the column setup to show the net change, balance at date, or even a comparison of the current period against a previous or future period.

## Learn more about the financial reporting feature

The **Financial Reports** feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries. The results display in charts and reports in your home page, such as the **Cash Flow** chart, and the **Income Statement** and **Balance Sheet** reports. You access these two reports, for example, with the **Financial Statements** action in the Business Manager and Accountant home pages.
