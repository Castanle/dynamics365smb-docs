# Financial Report (report)

The *Financial Report* report shows general ledger (G/L) transactions in a given period, grouped by user-defined setup of rows and columns.

You can 
* configure the report to add bolding, italics, underlines and page breaks to certain lines.
* change row setup to group several accounts from different areas of the general ledger together into one line.
* change column setup to show the net change, balance at date, or even a comparison of the current period against any previous or future periods.


## Learn more about the financial reporting feature

The **Financial Reports** feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries. The results display in charts and reports in your Role Center, such as the Cash Flow chart, and the Income Statement and Balance Sheet reports. You access these two reports, for example, with the **Financial Statements** action in the Business Manager and Accountant home pages.
