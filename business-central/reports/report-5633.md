# Maintenance Register (report)

The **Maintenance Register** report shows posted maintenance entries that are sorted and divided by register number. 

You can determine which registers' entries are shown by setting a filter. It is important to set a filter; otherwise, the report may show a very large amount of information.

The report can be defined so that it functions as a part of the posting process; that is, it can be printed when you post. To print the register when the journal is posted, on the Actions tab, in the Posting group, choose Post and Print in the journal.
