# Aged Accounts Payable (report)

The *Aged Accounts Payable* report shows the amount of outstanding invoices, credit memos and payments for vendors.

You can configure report aging to generate three equal length periods as of the specified date (i.e. three preceding months from the end of the current month). The vendor's outstanding balance is then calculated for each period, as well as any balances due before or after the three periods. 

Each period can be named from the actual start/end dates, or the total number of days included (i.e. 1 - 31 days).

A total percentage of outstanding amounts are calculated for each date range, to help you easily identify the company's current financial health.

The report can either show a summed balance for each vendor, or a detailed breakdown of each outstanding document for analysis.
