# Fixed Asset Register (report)

The *Fixed Asset Register* report shows posted fixed asset ledger entries that are sorted and divided by register number. 

You can see all the transactions posted for fixed assets with information such as FA posting date, document type and number, depreciation book code, fixed asset number and description, FA posting category and type, posting date, amount, and entry number. 

On the request page, you can set a filter for the relevant fixed asset. If you do not set any filters, the report shows the register for all fixed assets.

## About the Fixed Assets register
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] automatically assigns consecutive entry numbers to all entries that you post to depreciation books. In the FA registers, the entries are sorted in entry number order regardless of FA numbers or depreciation book numbers.

A register is created automatically with each posting, either directly from a fixed asset journal or indirectly from purchase invoices or sales invoices. The individual registers are also numbered (one is the first number).
