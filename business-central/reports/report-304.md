# Vendor - Detail Trial Balance (report)

The *Vendor - Detail Trial Balance* report shows your vendor balances at the end of the period by seeing the opening balance, shows each transaction within a given period, and the closing balance, all grouped by vendor.

You can specify a date range in the date filter and for each vendor the report will display the beginning balance, each transaction within the period, with its remaining amount and due date, and the ending balance. 

You can choose to run the report in your local currency or in the vendor's currency. Vendors that have not had any transactions for the period can also be excluded.


## Use cases

- Track each transaction within the period for accurate payment processing.
