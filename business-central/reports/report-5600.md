# Fixed Asset Analysis (report)

The *Fixed Asset Analysis* report is a flexible reporting option that provides a comprehensive examination of an organization's fixed assets, such as property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), for different purposes. 

You can specify two date columns and three data columns to see in the report. 

For example, to generate a report to use for reconciling with the general ledger, add columns for acquisition cost at ending date, depreciation at ending date, and book value at ending date. A check report could have acquisitions/net change, write-down/net change, and Appreciation/net change, so every change to fixed asset can be checked if necessary. 

If you select the **Budget Report** field and specify an ending date in the future, the report will calculate the future depreciation and can give estimates for future depreciation and book values, if you selected those fields as report columns.
