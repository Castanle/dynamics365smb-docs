# Purchase statistics (report)

[!INCLUDE [reports-purchase-statistics](../includes/reports-purchase-statistics.md)]


## Use cases

Use the report to keep track of vendor performance and ensure that your company is getting the best value for its money:
- Analyze total purchases, payments, and finance charges from each vendor.
- Compare the efficiency of different vendors over five periods.
- Identify trends in payment discounts taken or lost to inform negotiation strategies.

In your budgeting and financial forecasting processes, you can use the report to:
- Review financial outlays and cost savings from payment discounts.
- Monitor finance charges to ensure they are within acceptable limits.
- Use historical purchase data to project future spending.

For your accounts payable (AP) processes, use the report to ensure timely payments and manage discounts:
- Track upcoming payments and avoid missed discounts.
- Monitor overdue payments and the resulting finance charges.
