# Purpose and benefits of Subscription & Recurring Billing

## Contracts

Contracts are used to group multiple Service Objects and their Service Commitments so that they can be billed together on a recurring basis. A contract is the technical equivalent of one or more actual contract documents.

A contract defines the commercial framework (contractual partners, invoice recipients, accounting conditions). Service Objects (and their Service Commitments) represent the components of the contract.

## Service objects

A service object is something that the customer either buys or for which a contractual agreement is concluded, resulting in mutual obligations. A service object can thus be clearly assigned to a customer. The service object is usually static, but the associated service commitments can change. Furthermore, additional information can be stored in the Service Object that is independent of the service commitments themselves.

The service object itself does not contain any billing-relevant information - this belongs to the associated Service Commitments. Service commitments that are not invoiced via a contract can also belong to a service object.

## Service commitments

Service commitments describe the content of agreements with customers and suppliers. They exist in customer-side and vendor-side form and always belong to a service object. In addition, they contain billing information such as the quantity to be billed, the billing period and the amount. 

The service commitments of a service object and the creation of these service commitments are defined via a multi-level hierarchy. It includes service commitment templates and service commitment packages that can be assigned to items. Service objects are created via the sale of these items, to which the associated service commitments are visible.
