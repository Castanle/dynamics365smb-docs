# Overview of subscription and recurring billing

The **Subscription & Recurring Billing** app enables you to bill for contractually agreed Service Commitments on a recurring basis. The integrated flexible billing models support you and also take into account terms and notice periods.

Do you want to create accurate invoices for different price and subscription models in just a few steps? At the same time, do you want to minimize sources of error and bring transparency into the processes? All this is possible with **Subscription & Recurring Billing**.

## Flexible and user-friendly subscription management for Business Central

Every Service Object, whether it is a Sales Order, a rental agreement or any other contractual agreement between two parties, can be clearly assigned to customers. While the Service Object is usually static, the associated Service Commitments can change. Various billing information, such as billing period and amount, is usually stored with the individual Service Commitments in ERP systems, but not with the Service Object itself.

If you use **Subscription & Recurring Billing**, all relevant information can be combined in one system. This allows you to maintain an overview of contract management at all times. At the same time, your manual effort is reduced, as processes can be significantly simplified and automated. With our contract management system, you can effectively handle all steps - from the offer to monthly billing - for both sides.
