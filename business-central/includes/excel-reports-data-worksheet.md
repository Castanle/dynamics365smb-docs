This worksheet shows the raw data used in the report. The dataset for the report is aggregated, so the worksheet doesn't show individual transactions.

Use this worksheet for data analysis assisted by built-in tools in Excel, such as [!INCLUDE [excel-copilot-name](../includes/excel-copilot-name.md)], or the What-if-analysis or Forecast Sheet tools.
