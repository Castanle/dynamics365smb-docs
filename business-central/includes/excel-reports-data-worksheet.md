This worksheet shows the raw data used in the report. Note that the dataset for the report is aggregated, so the individual transactions are not present in the worksheet.

You can use this worksheet for data analysis assisted by built-in tools in Excel, such as [!INCLUDE [excel-copilot-name](../includes/excel-copilot-name.md)], or the What-if-analysis or Forecast Sheet tools.
