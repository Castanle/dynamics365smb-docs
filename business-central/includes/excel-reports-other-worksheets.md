The [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] platform always adds three system worksheets to Excel reports:

- TranslationData (text needed for multi-language reports), 
- CaptionData (text from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] fields needed for multi-language reports), 
- Aggregated Metadata (data about the report and when/how it was invoked).

All three worksheets are hidden by default. In case you want to learn more, please go to [System Excel workbooks](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-howto-excel-report-layout#system-excel-sheets) in the developer documentation.
