As a user, you can create your own report layouts with Excel, either from scratch or based on an existing layout. If you want to modify the layout for this report, you just need to export the *layout* (not the workbook resulting from running the report) from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)], change what you need, and then import the layout back into [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)].

To learn more, please go to [Export a report layout](../ui-excel-report-layouts.md#from-another-excel-report-layout).
