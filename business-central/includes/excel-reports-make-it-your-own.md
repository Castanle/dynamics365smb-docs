You can create your own report layouts with Excel, either from scratch or based on an existing layout. To modify the layout for the report, export the *layout* (not the workbook that resulted from running the report) from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)], make your changes, and then import the layout into [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)].

To learn more, go to [Export a report layout](../ui-excel-report-layouts.md#from-another-excel-report-layout).
