To generate a report about depreciation, acquisitions, and disposals for a selected period, and also the book value at the end of the period, you can use the 
following two reports:
- Book Value 01 
- Book Value 02 

The reports include similar information. However, the **Book Value 01** report displays one line for each asset and must be printed in landscape orientation. 

The **Book Value 02** report displays the information on several lines for each asset.
