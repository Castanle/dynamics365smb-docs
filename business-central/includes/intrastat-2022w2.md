> [!NOTE]
> In the 2022 release wave 2, Business Central includes a redesigned Intrastat experience with extended features. If you are a new customer using version 21 or newer, you are using the new experience. For customers who upgraded from previous releases, using the new experience depends on whether your administrator has enabled the **Feature Update: Replace the existing Intrastat functionality with the new Intrastat extension** option on the **Feature Management** page. Learn more at the [Set Up Intrastat Reporting](../finance-how-setup-report-intrastat.md) article. This article describes the previous functionality.
>
> The new feature will be automatically enabled and the old feature will be deprecated with the 2024 release wave 2.   

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's not possible to combine old and new experiences in parallel. Enabling and testing this feature in a sandbox environment with a copy of production data is recommended before activating the extension in a production environment. Once you activate the new Intrastat experience in your production environment, you can't revert back to the old Intrastat functionality.
