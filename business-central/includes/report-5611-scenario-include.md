See the net change posted in the fixed asset ledger entries for the fixed asset (FA) posting group. If general ledger integration is activated for a depreciation book, the amounts in the report should be the same as the net change in the general ledger accounts assigned to the fixed asset posting groups. As a result, the report can be used when reconciling the fixed asset ledger and general ledger.
