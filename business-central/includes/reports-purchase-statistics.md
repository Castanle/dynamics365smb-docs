The report shows purchase statistics for each vendor. The statistics include information for five periods, starting on the date that you specify.

The report includes the total purchases, payments, finance charges, and discount information, including the payment discounts taken and lost.

Statistics are calculated for:

* Purchases before the date entered, at three intervals of one month from the date entered.
* A period that includes all purchases made after the third one-month interval.
