# Manage AppSource apps
 
From inside [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can discover, view, sort, and filter available AppSource apps that integrate with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

On the **Microsoft AppSource Apps** page, you can filter available AppSource apps by name, publisher name, install state, popularity, average rating, number of ratings, and last modified date. You can also select a given app and see the details for that specific app.

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], find the **Microsoft AppSource Apps** page, by choosing the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, then enter **Microsoft AppSource Apps**, and then choose the related link.

On the page, you'll find the following actions: 
 
- **View AppSource** to open the online AppSource marketplace in a browser. 
- **View in AppSource** to open and view a selected app in the online AppSource Marketplace. 
- **Refresh list from Microsoft AppSource** to force a refresh of the list of all apps to AppSource marketplace contentâ€”for example, if you're looking for a newly submitted AppSource app.
 
As with other list pages, you get support for Analysis Mode, for example, so that you can group apps by publisher. Use Copilot to create the **Analysis Mode** view for you.
