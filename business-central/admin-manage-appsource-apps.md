# Manage AppSource apps
 
From inside [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can discover, view, sort, and filter available AppSource apps that integrate with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] through the **Microsoft AppSource Apps** page.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Microsoft AppSource Apps** page replaces the embedded AppSource experience, which is deprecated. 


 
From this page, you can view, sort, and filter available AppSource apps by name, publisher name, install state, popularity, average rating, number of ratings, and last modified date.
 
You can select a given app and see the details for that app.

You'll also find the following actions: 
 
- **View AppSource** to open the online AppSource marketplace in a browser. 
- **View in AppSource** to open and view a selected app in the online AppSource Marketplace. 
- **Refresh list from Microsoft AppSource** to force a refresh of the list of all apps to AppSource marketplace content—for example, if you're looking for a newly submitted AppSource app.
 
As with other list pages, you get support for Analysis Mode—for example, so that you can group apps by publisher.

You can even use Copilot to create the Analysis Mode view for you.
