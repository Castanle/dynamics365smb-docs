# Search for a Record in Your Data

When you want to find a particular record or value, use the ![Tell me what you want to do.](media/ui-search/search-list.png "Search for Page or Report") **Search** icon to look for it. To learn more about searching in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], go to [Finding Pages and Information with Tell Me](ui-search.md).

## How search works

[!INCLUDE [ui-how-search-works](includes/ui-how-search-works.md)]

## Getting started

You can speed up results by choosing the fields on the tables that you want to include in your searches. The tables and fields that you can choose from vary, depending on your Role Center. By default, all tables and fields are chosen, which can slow down the search. We recommend that you exclude as many tables and fields as you can.


To search for data in a list in Business Central, you can use the search functionality available within the application. Here are the steps to do so:

1. **Open Business Central**: Navigate to the Business Central application.
2. **Use the Search Box**: At the top of the page, you will find a search box. Type in the name of the list or the data you are looking for.
3. **Filter the List**: Once you have the list open, you can use the filter option to narrow down the data. Click on the filter icon and set your criteria to find specific records.
4. **Advanced Filters**: For more complex searches, you can use advanced filters. This allows you to combine multiple criteria to refine your search results.

If you need more detailed instructions or have specific requirements, feel free to ask!
