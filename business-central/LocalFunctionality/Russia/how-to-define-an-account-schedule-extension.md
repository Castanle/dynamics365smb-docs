2. Select the financial report for which you want to define an extension.
3. Select **Edit Financial Report**.
4. In the **Row No.** field, select the number of the financial report row for which you want to define an extension.
5. In the **Totaling Type** field, select **Custom**, and then select the table you want to use from the **Extension Source Table** field.

Based on your selections, the financial report information is filtered from the entry tables, and then new amounts are calculated for the specified financial report line.
