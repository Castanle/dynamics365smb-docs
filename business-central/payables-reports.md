# Accounts payable reports and analytics

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has built-in reports and analytics that can help you manage your accounts payable. The tools go  beyond traditional reporting constraints, and make it easy to design various types of reports.

## Accounts payable report overview

## Analyze your payment practice

You can use the [Payment Practice](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?page=687)| page to show how quickly you pay your vendors. You can base the report on a specific period, or by the size of the vendor company in terms of its number of employees. Some countries require this report. 

For more information, go to the [Payment practices page](ui-payment-practices.md).
