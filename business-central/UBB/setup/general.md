# General setup

In the **Service Contract Setup** page, general settings and default values for creating and managing Customer and Vendor Contracts (such as number series) are made.


## Usage Based Billing
Besides the settings for **DYCE Subscription & Recurring Billing**, no further settings are required for **DYCE Usage Based Billing**. These, however, always refer specifically to a [supplier](/docs/ubb/masterdata/suppliers.md) or a [method](/docs/ubb/masterdata/service-commitments.md) for price calculation.


## Permissions
The permissions shipped with **DYCE Usage Based Billing** extend the existing [permission sets](/docs/srb/setup/permissions.md#dyce-subscription--recurring-billing) of **DYCE Subscription & Recurring Billing**: <br/>
* DYCECONTRACTSALL (DYCE SRB All)
* DYCECONTRACTSUSER (DYCE SRB Users)
* DYCECONTRACTSADMIN (DYCE SRB Admin)
