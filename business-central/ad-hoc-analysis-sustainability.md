# Ad-hoc analysis of sustainability data

This article explains how to use the **Data Analysis** feature to analyze sustainability data directly from list pages and queries. You don't have to run a report or switch to another application, such as Excel. The feature provides an interactive and versatile way to calculate, summarize, and examine data. Instead of running reports using options and filters, you can add multiple tabs that represent different tasks or views on the data. Some examples are "Emmision overview" or "Emmision by Scope," or any other view you can imagine. To learn more about how to use the **Data Analysis** feature, go to [Analyze list and query data with analysis mode](analysis-mode.md).

Use the following list pages for ad-hoc analysis of sustainability data:

- [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220)


## Sustainability ad-hoc analysis scenarios

Use the **Data Analysis** feature for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis:

- If you don't want to run a report.
- If a report for your specific need doesn't exist.
- If you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on a part of your business.

The following sections provide examples of sustainability scenarios in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

| Area | To... | Open this page in analysis mode | Using these fields |
| ---- | ----- | ------------------------------- |------------------- |
| [Emmision overview (sum by category)](#example-emmision-overview-sum-by-category) | Analyze your emmisions by category. | [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220) | **Account Category**, **Account Name**, **Emmision NH4**, **Emmision CO2**, and **Emmision N2O**.|
| [Average emmissions by category](#example-average-emmissions-by-category) | Analyze your average emmisions by category. | [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220) | **Account Category**, **Account Name**, **Emmision NH4**, **Emmision CO2**, and **Emmision N2O**.|
| [Emmissions by scope](#example-emmissions-by-scope) | Analyze your emmisions by scope. | [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220) | **Emmision Scope**, **Account Category**, **Emmision NH4**, **Emmision CO2**, and **Emmision N2O**.|


## Example: Emmision overview (sum by category)

To analyze your emmisions by category, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220) list and turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field).
1. Turn on **Pivot** mode (located directly above the **Search** field).
1. Drag the **Account Category** and **Account Name** fields to the **Row Groups** area. Drag the fields in that order.
1. Drag the fields **Emmision NH4**, **Emmision CO2**, and **Emmision N2O** to the **Values** area.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Emmision overview (sum)** or something that describes this analysis for you.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

## Example: Average emmissions by category

To analyze your average emmisions by category, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220) list and turn on analysis mode.
1. Go to the **Columns** menu and remove all columns (select the box next to the **Search** field).
1. Turn on **Pivot** mode (located directly above the **Search** field).
1. Drag the **Account Category** and **Account Name** fields to the **Row Groups** area. Drag the fields in that order.
1. Drag the fields **Emmision NH4**, **Emmision CO2**, and **Emmision N2O** to the **Values** area.
1. For each field in the **Values** area, click on them and change the aggregation function to `Average`.
1. Rename your analysis tab to **Emmision overview (avg)** or something that describes this analysis for you.

The following image shows the result of these steps.

## Data foundation for ad-hoc analysis on sustainability

The information that you enter in a sustainability journal is temporary and can be changed while it's in that journal. When you post a sustainability journal, the information is transferred to sustainability ledger entries on individual sustainability accounts, where it can't be changed. However, you can post reversing or correcting entries. So, the [Sustainability Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=6220) list pages is the main data source for ad-hoc analysis of sustainability data.

To learn more about posting sustainability entries, go to [Record sustainability entries](finance-sustainability-journal.md).
