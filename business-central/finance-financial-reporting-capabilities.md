# Primary capabilities of financial reporting

This article describes the capabilities that are most widely used for the financial reporting feature in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Out of the box financial reporting

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] provides account categories, subcategories, and mappings to the companyâ€™s chart of accounts to give you basic financial reporting out of the box. If you haven't set up your own financial reporting, choose this option.

## Custom financial reporting

If you want more complex reports, you can create your own. If you already have established financial reporting, choose this option.

## Comparative views

Beyond monthly balances or net changes, you can apply multiple views to any report you create. For example, you can use formula combinations for standard month to date and year to date views, view trends over the last twelve-months, compare current amounts with the prior month or year, and more.

## Direct tie to the general ledger

Financial reporting is tied directly to detailed transactional postings from the general ledger.

## Use dimensions

Dimensions are data tags that attach to detailed transactional postings from the general ledger for the purpose of providing more robust financial reporting. Adding dimensions to financial reporting adds to the power of the reports and moves the capabilities of the reports beyond mere financial reporting and expands into operational reporting. 

## Budget integration

Financial reporting can easily compare budget and actual financial results. You can do the comparisons for any date range and view the results at the general ledger and dimension levels.

## Ability to drill down

Numbers shown in the financial reporting that aren't a calculated formula can be drilled down to the originating transactions which make up that higher level number. Active analysis can be done from the financial reporting to the account level, and from there to the invoices, credit memos, and ledger entries which make up that value. This quick research tool lets you determine where the number came from, when it happened, what type of document was used, and even which user created the entry.

## Export to Excel

The Export to Excel feature lets you quickly create financial reporting that's consistently formatted and looks the same every month without manual manipulation. These documents make it easy to produce a professional-looking financial package where values are simply updated each period.

## No coding needed

Financial reporting in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't require that you know how to code. With proper training, financial professionals can build their own reports and make changes exactly when they need to. It's helpful, however, to understand:

* The structure of the chart of accounts.
* The dimensions that are used.
* The budget amounts.
* The basic differences between balance sheet and income statement accounts.
* Basic formulas.
