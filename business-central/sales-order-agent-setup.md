Once it's activated, you configure the agent to monitor the desired mailbox, and manage user access to the agent.

The sales order agent is turned on by default. If the ![Shows the sales order agent icon](media/soa-icon.png) **Sales Order Agent** badge appears in the navigation menu at the top, then the agents is on, but not yet configured to process sales orders.

You turn the agent on or off from the **Copilot & AI Capabilities** page, as you do with other Copilot features in Business Central. The sales order agent is listed under **Production ready previews**. Learn more about in [Configure Copilot and AI capabilities](enable-ai.md).

The **Sales Order Agent** badge changes to ![Shows the sales order agent icon after configured](media/soa-activated-icon.png), which indicates the sales order agent is active ready to handle incoming sales quote requests to the mailbox.

When the sales order agent is active, a scheduled task that runs every minute on the mailbox is added to the job queue. This task monitors unread messages in the mailbox. If an unread message is found, the sales order agent imports the message into Business Central and verifies whether there is already a task for the mail thread. If a task for the thread already exists, the sales order agent incorporates the new message into the existing task. Otherwise, it creates a new task for the message.
